## What is Dok?

Dok is a simple & fast static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single Javascript configuration file called `dok.config.js`.

> **Dok** it's powered by [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) to apply the styles.
